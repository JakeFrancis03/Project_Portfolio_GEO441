        " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating both the slope by parcel map and the topography map of Oxford, there are a few key differences and similarities that each map combines. The topography elevation map, for example, provides a very good holistic view of the Oxford area. This map directly displays the areas of low and high elevation across the city. The slope by parcel map also does this in its display, yet it is specific to each parcel in the city, expressing the change in elevation. When combined, these maps actually display a lot of the same elevation data, representing the height of land either by specific parcels of the general area. This map is unique in the way that it includes a vector data layer to display these slope zonal statistics, while the topography model only used raster data and analysis."
