        " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose the *US Census 2020 Population Density* layer as my Raster choise for a few reasons. Firstly, I chose this data set due to the wide applicability and understanding which can be drawn from it. Considering many urban patterns like homeownership and rentiership are based upon values like population density, using these patterns seen in the population distribution link back to many patterns seen in housing affordability and therefore ownership. Additionally, this layer and data can be used to examine the differences in homeownership and rentiership in Ohio itself when looking at urban and rural areas, examining counties that have higher/lower homeowner rates and comparing it to the population density.\n",

Though you can zoom into state boundaries and even pst them towards local counties, there will be difficulties in actually using this layer effectivelt at those resolutions."
